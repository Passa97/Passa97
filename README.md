# Alexander Passanante's IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio 🔐

I’m really into cybersecurity, especially when it comes to digging into real problems and learning by doing. I’ve worked on things like vulnerability management and threat detection. Each project is a deep dive into the fast-moving world of cyber defense and helps me keep up and improve how security is handled in real scenarios. Feel free to take a look and see what I’ve been working on.
